Georgia, wrap me up in all your
I want you in my arms
Oh, let me hold you
I'll never let you go again like I did
Oh, I used to say
I would never fall in love again until I found her
I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you
Georgia pulled me in, I asked to
Love her once again
You fell, I caught you
I'll never let you go again like I did
Oh, I used to say
I would never fall in love again until I found her
I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you
I would never fall in love again until I found her
I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you
If I had to live my life without you near me
The days would all be empty
The nights would seem so long
With you I see forever, oh, so clearly
I might have been in love before
But it never felt this strong
Our dreams are young and we both know
They'll take us where we want to go
Hold me now, touch me now
I don't want to live without you
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You oughta know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You oughta know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through
But nothing's gonna change my love for you
If the road ahead is not so easy
Our love will lead the way for us
Like a guiding star
I'll be there for you if you should need me
You don't have to change a thing
I love you just the way you are
So come with me and share the view
I'll help you see forever too
Hold me now, touch me now
I don't want to live without you
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You oughta know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You oughta know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through
But nothing's gonna change my love for you
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You oughta know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You oughta know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through
But nothing's gonna change my love for you
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You oughta know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You oughta know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through
But nothing's gonna change my love for you
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love
How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think, I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love
How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love
How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
Lately you have been asking me
If all my words are true
Don't you know I'll do anything for you
Sometimes I haven't been good to you
Sometimes I've made you cry
And I am sorry for everything
But I promise you girl
I promise you this
When the blue night is over my face
On the dark side of the world in space
When I'm all alone with the stars above
You are the one I love
So there's no need to worry girl
My heart is sealed for you
And no one's gonna take it away
'Cause I promise you girl
I promise you this
When the blue night is over my face
On the dark side of the world in space
When I'm all alone with the stars above
You are the one I love
Your voice is calling to me in my dreams
My love is stronger than it's ever been
When the blue night is over my face
On the dark side of the world in space
When I'm all alone with the stars above
You are the one I love
When the blue night is over my face
On the dark side of the world in space
When I'm all alone with the stars above
You are the one I love
When I'm all alone with the stars above
You are the one I love
Take my hand
We'll walk a while, we'll talk a while
Feel my love, always there beside you
Be the one
I know you'll tell me everything
You are the one I cherish more than anything
… I love you more than you'll ever know
I love you more than you'll ever see
More than my heart could ever show
I love you more than you'll ever know
… Think of me
And know that I'll believe in you
There'll always be this precious time together
With every tear
A love so strong, no words could ever say
A love to last forever
… I love you more than you'll ever know
I love you more than you'll ever see
More than my heart could ever show
I love you more than you'll ever know
… Take my hand
We'll walk awhile, we'll talk awhile
Feel my love, always there beside you
Be the one
I know you'll tell me everything
You are the one I cherish more than anything
… I love you more than you'll ever know
I love you more than you'll ever see
More than my heart could ever show
I love you more than you'll ever know
Yeah
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way
Am I your fire?
Your one desire
Yes, I know it's too late
But I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way
Now I can see that we've fallen apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of me
You are my fire
The one desire
You are (you are, you are, you are)
Don't wanna hear you say
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake (don't wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say (oh, yeah)
I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say (never wanna hear you say)
I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say (don't want to hear you say)
I want it that way
'Cause I want it that way
Suddenly she's leaving
Suddenly the promise
Of love has gone
Suddenly breathing seems
So hard to do
Carefully
You planned it
I got to know just
A minute to late, oh girl
Now I understand it
All the times we
Made love together
Baby you were
Thinking of him
Why do I love you?
Don't even want to
Why do I love you
Like I do?
Like I always do
You should've told me
Why did you have
To be untrue?
Why do I love you
Like I do?
Ain't gonna show no
Weakness
I'm gonna smile
And tell the
Whole world
I'm fine
I'm gonna keep
My senses
But deep down
When no one can hear me
Baby I'll be crying for you
Why do I love you?
Don't even want to
Why do I love you
Like I do?
Like I always do
You should've told me
Why did you have
To be untrue?
Why do I love you
Like I do?
Can't go back
Can't erase
Baby your
Smiling face oh no
I can think of
Nothing else but you
Suddenly
Why do I love you?
Don't even want to
Why do I love you
Like I do?
Like I always do
You should've told me
Why did you have
To be untrue?
Why do I love you
Like I do?
